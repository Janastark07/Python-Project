## Python Project
## Developed a Predict The Price of Refurbished cars
## Poject Objective
To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the price of refurbished cars based on features such as brand, year, fuel type, transmission, mileage, engine size, and more.
## Dataset used
<a href="https://github.com/Janastark07/Python-Project/blob/main/Car%20Dataset.csv">Dataset</a>
## KPIs
 1.How accurate is the model at predicting car prices?
 2.What is the average difference between predicted and actual car prices?
 3.How fast can the model return a prediction?
 4.Which features most influence the predicted car price?
 
 ## Process
 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 3. Model Building & Evaluation
    
## Final Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict the prices of refurbished cars based on key vehicle attributes such as brand, year, fuel type, transmission, and mileage. After thorough data preprocessing and analysis, multiple regression models were evaluated, with Random Forest Regressor delivering the best performance, achieving a high RÂ² score and low error metrics. The model provides valuable insights into which factors most influence used car pricing, making it a practical tool for both buyers and sellers in the automotive resale market. With further improvements and deployment through a web interface, this solution can be scaled for real-world use in car dealerships or online resale platforms.
